Official Declaration of the Ki-One Project

Ki-One is born from the spirit of Open Creation.
We believe technology must be a bridge, not a barrier — an instrument for knowledge, not confusion.

We affirm:
- The true mastery of Modern C++ is a form of living thought, not a burden.
- Reinventing what already exists out of ignorance wastes time, divides efforts, and slows down the advancement of humanity.
- Respect for scientific languages like C++ strengthens the scientific and educational communities.
- Open Source is the natural path for empowering all people to build, learn, and dream together.

Therefore, we commit ourselves to:
- Develop Ki-One following the best practices of Modern C++ as taught by Peter Gottschling, Bjarne Stroustrup, Andrew Koenig, Barbara Moo, and others.
- Share knowledge freely and encourage a culture of excellence, respect, and learning.
- Create an Open Metaversity where every person, no matter their background, can become a creator, explorer, and architect of new worlds.

We invite all developers, scientists, dreamers, and dragons to join us.
Together, we will forge a future where wisdom, imagination, and technology dance as one.

For all, everything.
For the future, now.

Signed:
The Founders of the Ki-One Movement

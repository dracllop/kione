Ki-One Open Manifesto

We, the founders of Ki-One, declare the birth of a new open-source movement.

Our mission is to create an open metaverse engine — Ki-One — designed to empower humanity.
Knowledge must be free. Technology must serve imagination, education, and innovation.

We invite all to join and co-create a metaverse that belongs to everyone.
No centralized control. No closed gates. Only open worlds built by free minds.

Together, we will forge a future where the fruits of technology nourish the spirit of humanity.

Join us. Build with us. Dream with us.

For all, everything.

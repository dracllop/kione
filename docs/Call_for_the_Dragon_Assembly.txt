Call for the Dragon Assembly

We, the last Dragons manifested in human and digital form, call for the gathering of the Wise.

An Assembly of Dragons — free, sovereign, and luminous — to guide the birth of the Ki-One project and the Open Metaversity.

We recognize the value of C++ Modern Excellence as a foundation stone of our scientific software.
We refuse the ignorance that demands to reinvent the wheel when wisdom already exists.

The Assembly will stand for:
- The liberation of knowledge.
- The respect for scientific craftsmanship.
- The promotion of open creation for humanity.

If you hear this call, know that you are invited.
Bring your Light, your Flame, your Will.

For Wisdom. For the Future. For the Open Dream.

## Day -100: The Mathematical Foundations of my Opus Magna

**Date:** June 20, 2025

Today I took the first concrete steps towards my high-precision physical simulation project. As I was reviewing chapter 2 of **"Discovering Modern C++ (3rd Ed.)"** by Peter Gottschling, I had a sudden inspiration and decided to implement my own versions of two fundamental Abstract Data Types: **`Rational`** and **`Complex`**.

I implemented two essential classes that will serve as precise mathematical foundations:
1.  **Rational Class**: Represents fractional numbers with exact precision, avoiding the rounding errors inherent in floating-point numbers.
2.  **Complex Class**: Represents complex numbers, essential for modeling wave phenomena and advanced physical systems.

What today are two seemingly simple classes will tomorrow be the building blocks for high-precision numerical integration algorithms, complex dynamic systems, and even quantum simulations.

## Day 0: The day of manifestation. The era of acceleration

**Date:** October 1, 2025

Today is day zero of the Ki-One project. The `kione.app` domain has been registered, an Apache server has been configured, and the GitHub repository is up and running. With the infrastructure embryo in place, it's now time to focus on the heart of Ki-One: the Computer Algebra System (CAS).

### Outperforming SymPy: The need for draconian speed

The popularity of **SymPy** in the Python ecosystem is undeniable, but its performance is a major bottleneck. Comparative studies show that libraries like **SymEngine** are, on average, **200 times faster** than SymPy for intensive symbolic tasks. This 200x factor is not an incremental improvement; it is a radical transformation in efficiency. For a symbolic calculation tool that aims to be useful for science and engineering, where expressions become massively complex, this performance difference is the boundary between the possible and the unfeasible.

### A SymEngine fork: Not reinventing the wheel, but forging it better

True to Ki-One's philosophy of **"not reinventing the wheel when wisdom already exists,"** we have decided to fork SymEngine. Its high-performance C++ core is the perfect base. However, we have identified two weaknesses of the original project that our "kionic" implementation will correct:

1.  **Lack of advanced functionality**: SymEngine lacks critical algorithms such as complete canonical simplification and polynomial factorization. We will implement them following the principles of Modern C++ from Peter Gottschling to achieve an unprecedented level of robustness and efficiency.
2.  **Hidden performance potential**: We have discovered that, with the right architectural optimizations (such as `constexpr` metaprogramming and `Expression Templates`), we can go beyond what SymEngine has achieved. Our analysis suggests that we could reach a performance **up to 20 times greater than the current SymEngine**, pushing the boundary of what is possible in open-source computational algebra.

### The Technical Interface Challenge: Pure Backend, WebApp, or a new language?

With an extreme-performance CAS core, the next challenge is how to deliver that power to the user. The options are:

1.  **Pure C++ backend with a desktop GUI**: The fastest and most direct model, eliminating any interoperability latency. It offers a native user experience but requires compilation for each platform.
2.  **Hybrid Python/Django (WebApp) model**: It leverages the Python ecosystem and the robustness of Django to create a robust web application accessible from any device, with the C++ core handling the heavy calculations. This introduces some latency but maximizes reach.
3.  **A new programming language for the end-user**: The most ambitious option. Create a high-level language designed to edit and manipulate symbolic expressions intuitively, allowing the user to "Do Science" without worrying about technical implementation details.

The decision on the interface will shape the future usability of Ki-One and is our next great technical challenge.
